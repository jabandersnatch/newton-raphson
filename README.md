# Newton-Raphson Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Newton-Raphson algorithm in both 2D and 3D using Python. The algorithm is a numerical method for finding the roots of a function.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install scipy sympy numpy matplotlib
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook `lab5.ipynb` to explore the algorithm and its implementation.

## Jupyter Notebook as a Learning Guide

The Jupyter notebook `lab5.ipynb` serves as a learning guide to understand how to apply the Newton-Raphson algorithm. It provides step-by-step explanations and examples for both 2D and 3D cases.

The notebook also demonstrates how to use the following libraries for mathematical operations:

- `scipy`: for numerical optimization and root finding.
- `sympy`: for symbolic mathematics and equation manipulation.
- `numpy`: for efficient numerical computations.

## Plotting Results with Matplotlib

The notebook includes a dedicated section on how to plot the results using Matplotlib. It demonstrates how to visualize the roots and convergence behavior of the Newton-Raphson algorithm in both 2D and 3D.
